# Task given by Ajira Tech
In this task, I have made a static mock site in order to showcase my knowledge in Reactjs and redux.

## Completion of the task
_I have only completed a single but highly responsive page along with some static pages in the mockup due to limited time constraints._

## Things that I have developed
Made the home page and it's components as responsive by using CSS tweeks. Have added some smooth animations without the use of any external libraries. Also added some of my own design ideas in the navbar burger menu. Made each component from scratch. Have made a custom page router just by using redux which you can see when navigating through the navbar links. Have developed a responsive burger menu which when the screen resize above certain pixel width, it automatically disappears. 
**_The page and the contents are highly reponsive to the screen size._**

## Things that I haven't developed
I didn't complete the entire task i.e the other pages that have been mentioned. So I have only developed a single responsive page along with some other static pages from scratch without using any design frameworks or libraries for design or API for data.

## what could have been done to make the task entirely achievable
Usage of advanced and customizable design frameworks could have reduced the amount of time spent in doing a task which can be easily done using a design framework. Or giving a deadline that properly suits could have favoured.

## fun facts
I have embedded my personal site links (facebook, linkedin, github, youtube) in some of the navigation links that can be seen on the page.
