# Task given by Ajira Tech

In this task, I have made a static mock site in order to showcase my knowledge in Reactjs.

## Completion of the task

_I have only completed a single page in the mockup due to limited time constraints._

## Things that I have developed

Made the home page and it's components as responsive by using CSS tweeks. Have added some smooth animations without the use of any external libraries. Also added some of my own design ideas in the navbar burger menu. Made each component from scratch.

## Things that I haven't developed

I didn't complete the entire task i.e the other pages that have been mentioned. So I have only developed a single responsive page from scratch without using any design frameworks or libraries.

## what could have been done to make the task entirely achievable

Usage of advanced and customizable design frameworks could have reduced the amount of time spent in doing a task which can be easily done using a design framework. Or giving a deadline that properly suits could have favoured.
